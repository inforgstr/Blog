        <h2>What is the blog? And there description...</h2>
        <strong style="margin: 15px;">Blogs were one of the earliest and most effective means of communication in the social media sphere, besides forums. The Dictionary defines blog as “a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (posts).” The Merriam-Webster Dictionary1 (MWD) defines a blog as a ‘Web site on which someone writes about personal opinions, activities, and experiences; the things that a person writes on such a web site.” A blog can be used as a verb; blogger and blogging as nouns and its first known use were in 1999.Blog and Blogging</strong>

        A blogger is a publisher, creator, and distributor of content. Blogging is the art of creating content and the one who writes is called as a blogger. The blog is the combination of two words – web and logging which is a technique of online journaling. It is popularly described as a log of writings publicly posted on WWW.
        A blog contains contents that can be archived with entries arranged in calendar format with the most recent posts appearing first. A typical weblog has three elements — title, link, and description. Blogs are commentaries written on anything and everything in the universe. However, bloggers usually adhere to a specific subject which helps in forming virtual communities among like-minded people without physical, religious, ethnic or cultural boundaries. Most bloggers express their opinion on happenings; in that sense, it is more analytical and reactionary. There is a provision in a blog to receive comments on an article years after an entry is made. By contrast, comments on online news stories taper out within a few days. By tracking feedbacks and emails, a blogger gets to know what his/her readers are looking for; whether they were happy or unhappy with the post.
        After publishing a post, a blogger can share the links on social networking sites such as Twitter and FB. Sharing the content on social media is helpful in generating more traffic and promoting one’s blog. Also, you can own any number of blogs — you can have a food blog, political, fashion, health, education, and a travel blog. There is no restriction on running blogs on hosting sites.
        A blog is usually free for online viewers to read. Some blogs do seek mandatory registration or subscription from readers but such blogs are not commonly found. Blogs are a diary-kind of websites that are easier to launch, operate and maintain. The writer makes entries informally and they are arranged in reverse chronological order. The technology to set up a blog is easy and inexpensive, even free. Blog hosting services such as WordPress (WP) or Blogger offer various kinds of colour schemes and layouts.
        Search engine operations (SEO) on the Internet recognize blogs through high-quality content. SEOs are always on the lookout for new content. A blogger gives labels or tags which help SEOs in uploading new contents on the net. Google is the major search engine that gives ranking to blogs.
        Blogs can be hosted by blog hosting services or regular web hosting sites or by using blog software (Source: Wikipedia). Blogger is the most popular blog hosting site being used today according to critics. However, statistics on bloggers listed under it is not available to the public. Statistics of blogs listed on other popular blog hosting services worldwide are: Tumblr — 172 million blogs, Technorati — 1.3 million and WordPress — 75.8 million (February 2014 figures).
        Blogs get ranking from Alexa Internet, indiblogger.in (which gives scoring of Indian blogs) and Google. Google finds and ranks web pages based on the number of links made to them. Earlier, blog specialist search engine Technorati gave rankings based on the number of incoming links (Technorati stopped doing this from 2014). In August 2006, Technorati found that the most linked-to blog on the Internet was that of Chinese actress Xu Jinglei. Chinese media Xinhua reported that this blog received more than 50 million page views, claiming it to be the most popular blog in the world. Technorati had rated Boing Boing to be the most-read group-written blog (Source: Wikipedia).
